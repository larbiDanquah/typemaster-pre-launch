## Overview

### The challenge

The challenge was to build out this pre-launch landing page with code and get it looking as close to the design as possible

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Typemaster Pre-Launch Landing Page](https://larbidanquah.github.io/typemaster-pre-launch/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learnt a lot working on this project and the one thing that stuck with me was the ability to identify every element of the website as a box. It really helped me in structuring the content to best suite the design specification. I also had fun applying the knowledge I gained learning Flexbox and Grid. It helped make the implementation of the design a breeze.


### Useful resources

- [The MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Flexbox) - The MDN docs is mainly my goto. With this project, I used it a lot to gain some insights on some flexbox concepts.
- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - W3Schools has also helped me alot not only in this project but ever since I started web development. I still use it to this day.
